    <h1>My college life</h1>
    <p>I started university in 2019 ,I was 17(almost 18) years old.To be honest I was scared of getting in and fitting in the first time but I got over the anxiety pretty well.I found new friends that really fits my personality and we spend good times together.<br /></p>
    <p>I strugged managing my time during the first weeks of starting learning as it was way different than highschool.But then i started using my time well by going into library and everything just seemed to fit well.<br /></p>
    <p>Going back to the courses,the first semester was mostly things we already learnt in highschool but some of them are new.<br/></p>
    <p>After finishing the first semester,I was going to start my second semester but the COVID case hit and classes were delayed for a year,a whole year!but after a year of sitting in home doing nothing we got bacl again.But it was so messy,1 semester was like 2 month and we were rushing the courses a lot.<br /> </p>
    <p>The semester being this short really affected my grade,I wasn't able to keep up with what we are learning,there was a lot assignments ans exams that made our life so much worse.Till this semester,we were rushing like each semester was 2-3 month top but this year we are caught up to the time we wasted in our house and now I can finally calmly breath peacefully.<br /></p>
