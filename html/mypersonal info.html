        <h1>My personal information</h1>
        <main>
            <p>My name is Ephrem Alemayehu,I am a student in AAiT.I joined school when I about 4 and graduated from
                highschool
                when i was 17.I joined the Addis Ababa university on 2019 making me a 3rd year software student at this
                moment.<br /></p>
            <p>I love doing lots of stuff with friends,i once tried to built a plane with cartoon and paper with my friends
                and
                we tried to fly it but it was a big failure but it was fun to do and I gained lots of good experience from
                that.<br /></p>
            <p>I am trying to learn coding and programming now and its so much fun,i want to be a prefessional developer
                after 5
                years.I have set my mind and my time into it so I am sre i can achieve it<br /></p>
            <p>Acutally the thing that made me interested in coding is watching a tv series called <em>silicon
                    valley</em>.It
                was a show about 5 guys that are programmers and developers living under the same roof trying to survive
                life.They went through a lot of ups and downs and the ideas they come up with to buld their own company was
                very
                fascinating to see.The code and the software they trying to build amazed me to the level when i considered
                joining the software department and become a developer like them,it was quite the experience<br /></p>
            <p>Another thing I love is playing games.The immersive stories with well built characters and amazing game
                mechanics
                will definetely make the your gaming experiece worth ur time.It brings such nostalgia thinking about the old
                games I played with my little old PC and a small psp,it definitely defined my childhood<br /></p>
